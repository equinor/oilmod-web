<h1>Demo app to debug UI components</h1>

<p>You can test a module by importing it in app module - everything except styles can be imported as normal (from '@ngx-stoui/...').</p>
<p>CSS imports needs to be absolute, and pointing to the given project.</p>
<p style="color: red">For core, this is a bit problematic - a workaround is linking the library (in dist/stoui-core, run "npm link", and in root folder, run npm link @ngx-stoui/core)</p>
